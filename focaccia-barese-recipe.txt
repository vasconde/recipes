Ingredients:

For the Dough:
    1/2 cube yeast
    290 ml warm water
    250 g all purpose flour
    1/2 teaspoon salt

For the Topping:
    1 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
    2 tomatoes, cut into slices
    1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
    salt, to taste


Directions:

To make the Dough:
In the bowl combine the yeast and water.
Let stand until the yeast is dissolved, about 5-8 minutes.  
In another mixing bowl whisk together the flour and salt.
Add in the flour. Mix until a smooth, supple dough forms, about 8-10 minutes. 
Transfer the dough to a bowl brushed with olive oil.
Brush the ball of dough with more oil.
Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rise for 1 hour or
until doubled in volume.  Punch down the dough.

Make the Focaccia:
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.
Add the oil to a round pan and spread it evenly,
making sure you coat the bottom and sides of the pan.
Spread the dough to the edges of the pan with your fingers,
starting from the center and working your way out.  
Add the tomatoes and drizzle the remaining oil over them.
Sprinkle the oregano over the entire surface of the focaccia,
followed by a sprinkle of salt as desired. 
Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
Bake for 30-35 minutes.
